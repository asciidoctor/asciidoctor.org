This guide introduces the Asciidoctor processor and the output formats it produces.
You will learn how to:

- [x] process a document from the CLI and API
- [x] render a document to HTML
- [x] apply the default Asciidoctor CSS theme
- [x] render a document to DocBook 5

NOTE: In order to render your document, you'll need to have Asciidoctor installed.
For step-by-step installation instructions, read the {install-ref}[Installing the Toolchain] guide.
