While the AsciiDoc syntax is designed to be human-readable, it is doubtful you'll want to present your finished document as raw AsciiDoc syntax.
That's where the Asciidoctor or AsciiDoc processor and their backends come into play.

In this guide, you learn how to convert a short sample document to:

* HTML
* DocBook
* PDF

You'll also discover how to apply a custom stylesheet and JavaScript attributes to the HTML output during processing.

NOTE: In order to render your document, you'll need to have the Asciidoctor and AsciiDoc processors installed.
For step-by-step installation instructions, read the {toolchainref}[Installing the Toolchain] guide.

== Processors and backends overview

The Asciidoctor and AsciiDoc processors parse a document and translate it into a variety of formats, including HTML, DocBook and PDF.
The processor produces the output format by using a backend that you specify with the +-b+ (+--backend+) command-line option.
If no backend is indicated, the processor's default backend is used.

Asciidoctor has two native backends.

+html5+:: HTML 5 markup styled with CSS3.
Asciidoctor's default backend.
+docbook+:: DocBook XML 4.5 markup.

The AsciiDoc processor supports numerous backends, including:

+xhtml11+:: XHTML 1.1 markup styled with CSS2.
AsciiDoc's default backend.
+html5+:: HTML 5 markup styled with CSS3.
+docbook+:: DocBook XML 4.5 markup.
+pdf+:: Portable Document Format (PDF).

NOTE: A native PDF backend is planned for Asciidoctor.

== Converting a document to HTML

Asciidoctor provides both a command-line tool and a Ruby API for converting AsciiDoc documents to HTML.

=== Using a command-line tool

In this section, we'll create a sample document, then render and style it with Asciidoctor and the +html5+ backend.

. Create an AsciiDoc file like the one below
. Save the file as +sample.adoc+

----
 = Introduction to AsciiDoc
 Doc Writer <doc@example.com>

 A preface about http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc].

 == First Section

 * item 1
 * item 2

 [source,ruby]
 puts "Hello, World!"
----

To convert +sample.adoc+ to HTML from the command-line:

. Open a console
. Switch to the directory that contains the +sample.adoc+ document
. Call the Asciidoctor processor with the +asciidoctor+ command, followed by the name of the document you want to render

//end

 $> asciidoctor sample.adoc

Remember, Asciidoctor's default backend is +html5+, and therefore it isn't necessary to specify it with the +-b+ command.

You won't see any messages printed to the console.
If you type +ls+ or view the directory in a file manager, there is a new file named +sample.html+.

 $> ls
 sample.adoc  sample.html

Asciidoctor derives the name of the output document from the name of the input document.

=== Using the Ruby API

// TODO: expand this section 

Asciidoctor also includes a Ruby API that lets you generate an HTML document directly from a Ruby application.

[source,ruby]
----
require 'asciidoctor'

Asciidoctor.render_file('sample.adoc', :in_place => true)
----

Alternatively, you can capture the HTML output in a variable instead of writing it to a file.

[source,ruby]
----
html = Asciidoctor.render_file('sample.adoc', :header_footer => true)
puts html
----

=== Styles and attributes

Asciidoctor uses CSS for HTML document styling and JavaScript for generating document attributes such as a table of contents and footnotes.
It comes bundled with a fresh, modern stylesheet, named +asciidoctor.css+.
When you generate a document with the +html5+ backend, the +asciidoctor.css+ stylesheet is applied and linked automatically by default.
However, +asciidoctor.css+ is not automatically available to the generated HTML document; you have two choices:

. If you prefer to copy +asciidoctor.css+ to the output location and link to it from the generated document, set the +copycss+ attribute:

 $> asciidoctor -a copycss sample.adoc

. If you prefer to embed the stylesheet into the document, unset the +linkcss+ attribute:

 $> asciidoctor -a linkcss! sample.adoc

Just browse to +sample.html+ in your browser and checkout the result!

TIP: +linkcss!+ (which implies "embed css") embeds any stylesheet, not just +asciidoctor.css+.

IMPORTANT: +linkcss+ is set by default, unlike in AsciiDoc.
We believe linking to the stylesheet is a better default, certainly a accepted practice on the web.

If you unset the stylesheet attribute, Asciidoctor will generate HTML without any styles:

 $> asciidoctor -a stylesheet! sample.adoc

One of Asciidoctor's strengths is the ease in which you can swap the default stylesheet for your own custom stylesheet or alternative Asciidoctor themes.

To view the Asciidoctor themes in action, visit the {factoryshowcase}[theme showcase].
For information on using the stylesheets in the Asciidoctor Stylesheet Factory, read the {buildref}[Building the Asciidoctor Factory Themes guide] or explore the {factoryrepo}[Factory's repository].

If you want to apply your own stylesheet to the rendered HTML:

. Save it in the same directory as +sample.adoc+
. Call the +asciidoctor+ processor
. Add the +stylesheet+ attribute with +-a+ (+--attribute+)
. Include the stylesheet file's name

//end

 $> asciidoctor -a stylesheet=mystyles.css sample.adoc

To have Asciidoctor embed the contents of the stylesheet in the generate HTML document, use:

 $> asciidoctor -a stylesheet=mystyles.css -a linkcss! sample.adoc

Stylesheets can also be stored in the +stylesheets+ directory, but then you need to tell Asciidoctor where to look for them using the +stylesdir+ attribute.

 $> asciidoctor -a stylesdir=./stylesheets -a stylesheet=mystyles.css sample.adoc

TIP: The {customthemeref}[Custom Theme guide] provides detailed steps for using your custom stylesheet with Asciidoctor.

A stable of attributes are also available to add feature and style customizations to the rendered HTML.

// TODO: expand this section 

For example, you can activate syntax highlighting options in the code with this argument:

 -a source-highlighter=highlightjs 

If you have image references in your document, you'll have to move those with the output document.
Or, by passing the +data-uri+ attribute to the processor, you can embed the images into the document.

 $> asciidoctor -a data-uri sample.adoc

If you want the document to include a table of contents, pass the +toc+ attribute to the processor:

 $> asciidoctor -a data-uri -a toc sample.adoc

Alternatively, if you want to use +data-uri+ and +toc+ by default, you can add them to the header of the document.

----

 Doc Writer <doc@example.com>
 :data-uri:
 :toc:

----

If you include the attributes in the document's header, you do not need to pass them through the processor when you render the document.

.Converting a document to HTML with AsciiDoc
****

While AsciiDoc comes with two HTML backends, we'll use the +html5+ backend to render +sample.adoc+.

In your command prompt, specify the +html5+ backend with +-b+ and execute the following command:

 $> asciidoc -b html5 sample.adoc

AsciiDoc ships with a blue default theme, +asciidoc.css+, and two alternative themes named flask and volnitsky.
People tend to prefer the flask theme, which you can enable using the +theme+ attribute:

 $> asciidoc -b html5 -a theme=flask sample.adoc

The AsciiDoc +theme+ attribute is used to select an alternative CSS stylesheet and include optional JavaScript code.
AsciiDoc also allows users to create their own themes.
See the {userguide}#X99[Themes] chapter in the AsciiDoc User Guide to learn more.

NOTE: Currently, Asciidoctor does not support the +theme+ attribute.
Stylesheets can only be applied via the +stylesheet+ attribute.

As in Asciidoctor, you can also override the default stylessheet and supply your own with the +stylesheet+ attribute.

 $> asciidoc -b html5 -a stylesheet=mystyles.css sample.adoc

AsciiDoc embedds the stylesheet into the document.

Optional attributes such as +data-uri+, +toc+, and footnotes, are called and processed by AsciiDoc just as they are in Asciidoctor.

For example, to embed images into +sample.adoc+ with the AsciiDoc processor, type:

 $> asciidoc -b html5 -a data-uri sample.adoc

Or add +data-uri+ to the header of the document:

----

== Converting a document to DocBook

Despite the fact that writing in DocBook is inhumane, it's useful as a intermediary format.
And, since the AsciiDoc syntax was designed with DocBook output in mind, the conversion is very good.
There's a corresponding DocBook element for each markup in the AsciiDoc syntax.

To convert the +sample.adoc+ document to DocBook format, call the processor with the backend flag set to +docbook+:

 $> asciidoctor -b docbook sample.adoc

A new XML document, named +sample.xml+, will now be present in the current directory.

 $> ls
 sample.adoc  sample.html  sample.xml

If you're on Linux, you can view the DocBook file with {yelp}[Yelp].

 $> yelp sample.xml

Using the Asciidoctor Ruby API, you can generate a DocBook document directly from a Ruby application:

[source,ruby]
----
Asciidoctor.render_file('sample.adoc', :in_place => true,
    :backend => 'docbook')
----

DocBook is only an intermediary format in the toolchain.
You'll either feed it into a system that processes DocBook (like {publican}[publican]), or you can convert it to PDF using the +a2x+ command from AsciiDoc.

== Converting a document to PDF using +a2x+

PDF is a nice format for presenting a final version of a document.
For legacy reasons, the conversion to PDF is handled by a separate program in the AsciiDoc distribution, {a2x}[+a2x+].

+a2x+ accepts a DocBook file, like the +sample.xml+ file created in the section above, as input and converts it to a PDF.

In your console: 

. Call the +a2x+ program
. Select the output format with +-f+ (+--format+)
. Followed by the format type +pdf+

//
 $> a2x -f pdf sample.xml

A PDF document, named +sample.pdf+, will now be present in the current directory:

 $> ls
 sample.adoc  sample.html  sample.pdf  sample.xml

You can view the PDF using any PDF viewer.

Rather than converting from AsciiDoc to DocBook and then from DocBook to PDF in two steps, +a2x+ can go directly from AsciiDoc to PDF in a single call:

 $> a2x -f pdf sample.adoc

== Output galore

There's really no end to the customization you can apply to the output that the AsciiDoctor and AsciiDoc processors generate.
We've just scratched the surface here.

== Resources and help

There are a number of specialized backends available or under development for Asciidoctor.
More information and the latest available developments can be found in the project's {backendrepo}[backend repository].

Please consider joining the {mailinglist}[Asciidoctor mailing list], where you can ask questions and leave comments.
If you identify an issue while using a backend with the Asciidoctor processor, please don't hesitate to {backendissue}[file a bug report].
