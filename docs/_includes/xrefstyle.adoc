- user-manual: Customizing the Cross Reference
////

Starting in Asciidoctor 1.5.6, when you use one of the native converters (HTML, PDF, and EPUB3), you can customize the style of the automatic cross reference text using the `xrefstyle` document attribute.
This customization brings the cross reference text formatting from the DocBook toolchain to the native Asciidoctor converters.

By default, the cross reference text is the title of the referenced element.
For example, if you're linking to a section titled “Installation”, the text of the cross reference link appears as:

....
Installation
....

If the reftext attribute is specified on the referenced element, that value is preferred over its title.
For example, let's assume the section from the previous example is written as:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[reftext="Installation Procedure"]
=== Installation
----

In this case, the text of the cross reference link is shown as:

....
Installation Procedure
....

Attribute references are substituted in the reftext during parsing and reftext substitutions (specialchars, quotes, and replacements) are applied to the value when it's used during conversion.

If the reftext is not specified, the text of the cross reference is automatically generated.
As mentioned above, the default behavior is to use the title of the reference.
There are three built-in styles you can choose from to customize the generated text of a cross reference, as controlled by the xrefstyle document attribute.

 :xrefstyle: full:: Uses the reference signifier (e.g., Section) followed by the reference number and emphasized (chapter or appendix) or quoted title (e.g., Section 2.3, “Installation” or Figure 1, “Big Cats”).
 :xrefstyle: short:: Uses the reference signifier (e.g., Section) followed by the reference number (e.g., Section 2.3 or Figure 1).
 :xrefstyle: basic:: Uses the title only (Installation or Big Cats), applying emphasis if the reference is a chapter or appendix.

This formatting only applies to references that have both a title and number (or explicit caption), but no explicit reftext.
If the reference is a chapter or an appendix, the title is displayed in italics instead of quotes (even when the xrefstyle is basic).

Let's assume you want to reference a section titled “Installation” that has the number 2.3.
The *full* style is displayed as:

....
Section 2.3, “Installation”
....

The *short* style is displayed as:

....
Section 2.3
....

The *basic* style is displayed as:

....
Installation
....

You can customize the signifier that precedes the reference number, hinting at the reference's type (e.g., Chapter, Section, etc.).
For example, to customize the word “Section”, define the `section-refsig` document attribute:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:section-refsig: Sect.
----

The *full* xrefstyle would then be displayed as:

....
Sect. 2.3, “Installation”
....

If you unset the attribute, the signifier is dropped from the cross reference text.
For example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:!section-refsig:
----

In this case, the *full* xrefstyle will display only the number and title:

....
2.3, “Installation”
....

The *short* xrefstyle will fall back to the number only:

....
2.3
....

The *basic* xrefstyle is unaffected by the value of the reference signifier.

Currently, only the aforementioned styles are provided out of the box.
Support for a custom formatting string is planned.
Refer to {issue-ref}/2212[#2212] for details.
Until then, you can implement custom formatting in a custom converter or overridding the xreftext method on the node.
