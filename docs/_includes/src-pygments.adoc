{pygments-org}[Pygments] is a popular syntax highlighter that supports a broad range of {pygments-lang}["programming, template and markup languages"].

In order to use Pygments with Asciidoctor, you need https://www.python.org[Python 2] and the {pygments-gem}[pygments.rb] gem (which bundles http://pygments.org[Pygments]).

TIP: You _do not_ need to install Pygments itself.
It comes bundled with the pygments.rb gem.

IMPORTANT: You must have Python 2 install.
Python 3 is not sufficient to use Pygments with the pygments.rb gem.
Check that you have a `python2` (Linux, OSX) or `py -2` (Windows) binary on your PATH.

.Installing Python and the pygments.rb gem via the CLI (cross platform)
[source,console]
....
$ "`\which apt-get || \which dnf || \which yum || \which brew`" install python # <1>
$ gem install pygments.rb # <2>
....
<1> Install Python using your package manager
<2> Install the pygments.rb gem

Once you've installed these libraries, assign `pygments` to the `source-highlighter` attribute in your document's header.

:source-highlighter: pygments

You can further customize the source block output with additional Pygments attributes.

[horizontal]
pygments-style::
Sets the name of the color theme Pygments uses.
To see the list of available style names, see <<listing-pygments-style-names>>.
Default: `pastie`.
pygments-css::
Controls what method is used for applying CSS to the tokens.
Can be `class` (CSS classes) or `style` (inline styles).
Default: `class`.
pygments-linenums-mode::
Controls how line numbers are arranged when line numbers are enabled on the source block.
Can be `table` or `inline`.
Default: `table`.

.Customizing a source block with Pygments attributes
[source]
....
:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: manni
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline

[source,ruby,linenums]

ORDERED_LIST_KEYWORDS = {
  'loweralpha' => 'a',
  'lowerroman' => 'i',
  'upperalpha' => 'A',
  'upperroman' => 'I'
   #'lowergreek' => 'a'
   #'arabic'     => '1'
   #'decimal'    => '1'
}

.Printing the list of Pygments style names
[TIP#listing-pygments-style-names]
====
To list the available Pygments styles, run the following command in a terminal:

 $ $(dirname $(gem which pygments.rb))/../vendor/pygments-main/pygmentize -L styles

The pygments.rb gem uses a bundled version of Pygments (often ahead of the latest release).
This command ensures that you are invoking the `pygmentize` command used by that gem.

If you already have Pygments installed on your system, and you're invoking Asciidoctor via the API, you can instruct Asciidoctor to use your own installation of Pygments by adding the following line before invoking Asciidoctor the first time:

[source,ruby]
----
Pygments.start '/path/to/pygments'

====

See the <<user-manual#hl-css,Pygments stylesheet section>> to learn about the `pygments-css` attribute.
