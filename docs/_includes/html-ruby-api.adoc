HTML output section

== Using the Ruby API

This document is included in render-documents and the user-manual.

Asciidoctor also includes a Ruby API that lets you generate an HTML document directly from a Ruby application.

[source,ruby]
----
require 'asciidoctor'

Asciidoctor.render_file('mysample.adoc', :in_place => true)
----

Alternatively, you can capture the HTML output in a variable instead of writing it to a file.

[source,ruby]
----
html = Asciidoctor.render_file('mysample.adoc', :header_footer => true)
puts html
----
