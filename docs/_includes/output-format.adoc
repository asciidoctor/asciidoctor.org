The Asciidoctor processor parses an AsciiDoc document and converts it to a variety of formats, including HTML, DocBook and PDF.
The processor produces the output format by using a backend that you specify with the +-b+ (+--backend+) command line option.
If no backend is indicated, the processor uses the default backend (+html5+).

Asciidoctor has three native backends.

+html5+:: HTML 5 markup styled with CSS3.
Asciidoctor's default backend.
+docbook+:: DocBook XML 5.0 markup.
+docbook45+:: DocBook XML 4.5 markup.

//`xhtml5`:: XHTML 5 markup.

It also has several backends that can be plugged in.

+manpage+:: Manual pages for Unix and Unix-like operating systems.
+pdf+:: Portable Document Format (PDF).
+deckjs+:: Deck.js slideshow.
