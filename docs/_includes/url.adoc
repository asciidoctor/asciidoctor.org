A Uniform Resource Link (URL) represents the location of a resource on the web.
Typical URLs contain a scheme, domain name, file name, and extension.

// tag::basic[]
Asciidoctor recognizes the following common schemes without the help of any markup.

[[schemes]]
* http
* https
* ftp
* irc
* mailto
* \email@email.com

Since the URL in the example below begins with _http_, Asciidoctor will automatically turn it into a hyperlink when it is processed.

include::ex-url.adoc[tags=base-co]
----
<1> The trailing period will not get caught up in the link.

To prevent automatic linking of an URL, prepend it with a backslash (`{backslash}`).

If you prefer URLs to be rendered without a visible scheme, set the `hide-uri-scheme` attribute in the document's header.

[source]
----
:hide-uri-scheme:

http://asciidoctor.org
----

When the hide-uri-scheme attribute is set, the above URL will render as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<a href="http://asciidoctor.org">asciidoctor.org</a>
----

Note the absence of _http_ inside the `<a>` element.

To attach a URL to text, enclose the text in square brackets at the end of the URL.

----
include::ex-url.adoc[tags=irc]
----
// end::basic[]

Additionally, you can format the linked text.

.Rendered URLs

// tag::link[]
When a URL does not start with one of the <<schemes,common schemes>>, you must use the `link` macro.
The URL is preceded by `+link:+` and followed by square brackets.
The square brackets can include optional link text, target preference, and roles.

.Anatomy of a link macro
----
link:url[optional link text, optional target attribute, optional role attribute]
----

First, let's look at an example of a link macro that contains link text.

----
include::ex-url.adoc[tags=scheme]

====
include::ex-url.adoc[tags=scheme]
====
// end::link[]

.Troubleshooting Complex URLs
****
A URL may not render correctly when it contains characters such as underscores (`_`) or carets (`{caret}`).
include::ts-url-format.adoc[tags=sb]
****

Next, we'll add a target and role to a link macro.

// tag::attr[]
[[link-macro-attributes]]
When you set attributes in the link macro, you must also set the `linkattrs` attribute in the document's header because Asciidoctor does not parse attributes in the link macro by default.
Once you've set linkattrs in the header, you can then specify the name of the target window using the `window` attribute.

include::ex-url.adoc[tags=linkattrs-h]
----

====
include::ex-url.adoc[tags=linkattrs]
====

Since `_blank` is the most common window name, we've introduced shorthand for it.
Just end the link text with a caret (`+^+`):

[source]
----
include::ex-url.adoc[tags=linkattrs-s]
----

CAUTION: If you use the caret syntax more than once in a single paragraph, you may need to escape the first occurrence with a backslash.

When linkattrs is set, you can add a role (i.e., CSS class) to the link.

TIP: Links with attributes (including the subject and body segments on mailto links) are a feature unique to Asciidoctor.
When they are enabled, you must surround the link text in double quotes if it contains a comma.
// end::attr[]
