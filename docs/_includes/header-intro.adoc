The document header is a special group of contiguous lines at the start of the document that encapsulates the document title, author attribution, revision information, and document-wide attributes configured or defined by the user.

The header typically begins with a document title, though this element is optional.
If a document title is specified, it may be immediately followed by two optional lines of text that set the author attribution and revision information.
Finally, any document-wide settings are declared using attribute entries.
These attributes may proceed the document title as well.
A header may even consist of attribute entries only.
The first blank line marks the end of the header.

*The document header must _not_ contain any blank lines!*

Comment lines may be included in the header, as long as those lines are directly adjacent to the other lines in the header.

The header is _not required_ when the `doctype` is `article` or `book`.
//If absent, Asciidoctor will render the content that is present.
However, a header must be present when the document type is `manpage`.
The requirements for a manual page (man page) are described in the <<user-manual#man-pages,man pages>> section.

The header is processed when converting a full document.
This means that the header of a document called via an <<user-manual#include-directive,include directive>> will be processed and rendered.
When you do not want the header of a document to be rendered, set the `noheader` or `no-header-footer` attribute in the document's header or the CLI.

.Front matter
****
Many static site generators, such as Jekyll and Middleman, rely on front matter added to the top of the document to determine how to render the content.
Asciidoctor has a number of attributes available to correctly handle front matter.
See the <<user-manual#static-website-generators,static website generators>> section to learn how Asciidoctor integrates with static website generators.

Now let's explore the document title in detail.
