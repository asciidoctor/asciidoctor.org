You can pass multiple source files (or a file name pattern) to the Asciidoctor CLI and it will process all the files in turn.

Let's assume there are two AsciiDoc files in your directory, [file]#a.adoc# and [file]#b.adoc#.
When you enter the following command in your terminal:

 $ asciidoctor a.adoc b.adoc

Asciidoctor will process both files, transforming [file]#a.adoc# to [file]#a.html# and [file]#b.adoc# to [file]#b.html#.

To save you some typing, you can use the glob operator (+*+) to match both files using a single argument:

 $ asciidoctor *.adoc

The shell will expand the previous command to the one you typed earlier:

 $ asciidoctor a.adoc b.adoc

You can also render all the AsciiDoc files in immediate subfolders using the double glob operator (+**+) in place of the directory name:

 $ asciidoctor **/*.adoc

To match all files in the current directory and immediate subfolders, use both glob patterns:

 $ asciidoctor *.adoc **/*.adoc

If the file name argument is quoted, the shell will not expand it:

 $ asciidoctor '*.adoc'

This time, the text +*.adoc+ gets passed directly to Asciidoctor instead of being expanded to [file]#a.adoc# and [file]#b.adoc#.
In this case, Asciidoctor handles the glob matching internally in the same way the shell does (when the file name is not in quotes)--with one exception.
Asciidoctor can match files in the current directory and subfolders at any depth using a single glob pattern:

 $ asciidoctor '**/*.adoc'
 
TIP:: If you process multiple nested AsciiDoc files at once and are also applying a custom stylesheet to them, you'll need to <<user-manual#style-nest-doc,manage the stylesheet's location>>.
