A document title must be placed on the first line of the document.
It is preceded by one equal sign followed by at least one space (++= ++), and then the text of the title.

Here's an example of a document title followed by an abbreviated paragraph.

.Document with a title

----
include::sect0-title.adoc[]

.Result: Rendered document title

When +doctype+ is set to +article+ or +manpage+, a document can have only one section level 0 title.
The +book+ document type can have multiple section level 0 titles.
The first section level 0 title, located in the header, is the document's title, and subsequent section level 0 titles are considered the titles of parts.

A document's title is assigned to the built-in +doctitle+ attribute.
Its value is identical to the value returned by +Document#doctitle+ and +sect0+.
The +doctitle+ attribute can be referenced anywhere in a document and displays the document's title when rendered. 

.Referencing the +doctitle+ attribute

----
include::doctitle.adoc[]

.Result: +doctitle+ output

You can control whether or not the title is displayed when the document is rendered with the attributes +notitle+ and +showtitle+.
If you don't want the title to be rendered, set the +notitle+ attribute in the header or CLI.
On the other hand, the title is not displayed when a document's header and footer are disabled.
The header and footer are disabled when a document is embedded.
In this case, set the +showtitle+ attribute in order to render the title.

Let's see how to add additional information to the header, including an author and her email address.
