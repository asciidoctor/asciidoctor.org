The document title is written as a level-0 section, which consists of a single equal sign followed by at least one space (i.e., `={sp}`), then the text of the title.
It must be the first level-0 section in the document.
The only content allowed before the document title are blank lines, comment lines and attribute entries.

Here's an example of a document title followed by an abbreviated paragraph.

.Document with a title

----
include::ex-header-title.adoc[tags=base]

.Result: Rendered document title

When `doctype` is set to `article` or `manpage`, a document can have only one level-0 section title.
The `book` document type can have multiple level-0 section titles.
The first level-0 section title, located in the header, is the document's title, and subsequent level-0 section titles are considered the part titles.

A document's title is assigned to the built-in `doctitle` attribute.
//Its value is identical to the value returned by `Document#doctitle`.
The doctitle attribute can be referenced anywhere in a document and displays the document's title when converted.

.Referencing the doctitle attribute

.Result: doctitle output

You can control whether or not the title is displayed when the document is rendered with the attributes `notitle` and `showtitle`.
If you don't want the title to be rendered, set the `notitle` attribute in the header or CLI.
On the other hand, the title is not displayed when a document's header and footer are disabled.
The header and footer are disabled when a document is embedded.
In this case, set the `showtitle` attribute in order to render the title.

Asciidoctor recognizes a subtitle in the primary level-0 heading. If the primary title contains at least one colon, Asciidoctor treats the text after the final colon as a subtitle.

NOTE: The subtitle is not displayed in the `html5` backend. It is displayed in the `docbook`, `epub3`, and `pdf` backends.

.Document with a subtitle
[source]
----
include::ex-header-title.adoc[tags=sub-1]
----

In this example, the following is true:

Primary title::
  "The Dangerous and Thrilling Documentation Chronicles", which is output when `\{doctitle}` is used in the document.
Subtitle::
  A Tale of Caffeine and Words

.Document with a subtitle and multiple colons
[source]
----
include::ex-header-title.adoc[tags=sub-2]
----

In this example, the following is true:

Primary title::
  "A Cautionary Tale: The Dangerous and Thrilling Documentation Chronicles", which is output when `\{doctitle}` is used in the document.
Subtitle::
  A Tale of Caffeine and Words



Asciidoctor also provides an API for extracting the title and subtitle. See the following line for information: https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/blob/master/lib/asciidoctor/document.rb#L601

Let's see how to add additional information to the header, including an author and her email address.
