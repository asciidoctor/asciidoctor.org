HTML output section

== Using a command line tool

This document is included in render-documents and the user-manual.
////

In this section, we'll create a sample document, then process and render it with Asciidoctor's +html5+ backend.

. Create an AsciiDoc file like the one below
. Save the file as +mysample.adoc+

----
include::mysample.adoc[]
----

To convert +mysample.adoc+ to HTML from the command line:

. Open a console
. Switch to the directory that contains the +mysample.adoc+ document
. Call the Asciidoctor processor with the +asciidoctor+ command, followed by the name of the document you want to render

//^

 $ asciidoctor mysample.adoc

Remember, Asciidoctor's default backend is +html5+, so it isn't necessary to specify it with the +-b+ command.

You won't see any messages printed to the console.
If you type +ls+ or view the directory in a file manager, there is a new file named +mysample.html+.

 $ ls
 mysample.adoc  mysample.html

Asciidoctor derives the name of the output document from the name of the input document.

Open +mysample.html+ in your web browser.
Your document should look like the image below.

====
image::mysample.png[]
====

The document's text, titles, and link is styled by the default Asciidoctor stylesheet, which is embedded in the HTML output.
As a result, you could save +mysample.html+ to any computer and it will look the same.
