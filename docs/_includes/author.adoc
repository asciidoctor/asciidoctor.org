The author of a document is listed on the line beneath the document's title.
An optional email address can follow an author's name.

Let's add an author and her email address to the document below.

As you can see in the example above, Asciidoctor uses the author's name and email to assign values to a number of built-in attributes that can be used throughout the document's body.
These attributes include:

[horizontal]
`author`::
The author's full name, which includes all of the characters or words prior to a semicolon (`;`), angle bracket (`<`) or the end of the line.

`firstname`::
The first word in the author attribute.

`lastname`::
The last word in the author attribute.

`middlename`::
If a firstname and lastname are present, any remaining words or characters found between these attributes are assigned to the middlename attribute.

`authorinitials`::
The first character of the firstname, middlename, and lastname attributes.

`email`::
An email address, delimited by angle brackets (`<>`).

If the author's first, middle or last name consists of more than one word, use an underscore (`+_+`) between the words.
The author of the following document has two middle names.

.Result: Rendered author information when author has two middle names

Alternatively, the author and email attributes can be set explicitly in the header.

The `html5` and `docbook` converters can render documents with multiple authors.
Multiple authors and their emails are separated by semicolons (`;`) when they're listed on the same line.

[source]
----
include::ex-author.adoc[tags=multi]
----
<1> To reference the additional authors in the document body, the author attributes are appended with an underscore (`+_+`) followed by the position of the author in the author information list (i.e. Lazarus het Draeke is the second author in the list so his author attributes are appended with a 2).

.Result: Rendered author information when document has multiple authors

If you want to enter multiple authors and their emails as attribute entries, the attribute names are as follows:

[source]
----
include::multi-author-email-long.adoc[]

.Result

Where does +authored+ (empty string '' if {author} or {email} defined) fit in?
