While it would seem as though the number of asterisks represents the nesting level, that's not how depth is determined.
A new level is created for each unique marker encountered.
However, it's much more intuitive to follow the convention that the number of asterisks equals the level of nesting.
After all, we are shooting for plain text markup that is readable _as is_.
