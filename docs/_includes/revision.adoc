A document's revision information contains three optional attributes.

[horizontal]
+revnumber+::
The document's version number which must contain at least one numeric character.
Any letters or symbols preceding the numeric character will not be rendered.

+revdate+::
The date the document version was completed.
When the +revnumber+ or +revremark+ attributes are set, but +revdate+ is not, then +revdate+ will be assigned the +docdate+ value.

+revremark+::
Information about this version of the document.

The revision information is listed on the third line of the header, beneath the author information line.

<1> +revnumber+ and +revdate+ must be separated by a comma (+,+).
<2> +revdate+ can contain words, letters, numbers, and symbols.
<3> The +revremark+ attribute must be preceded by a colon (+:+), regardless of whether +revnumber+ or +revdate+ are set.

.Result: Rendered revision information displayed on the byline and referenced in the document's body

When rendered, the +revnumber+ in the byline is preceded by the word _Version_; however, when referenced in the body of the document, only the numerical value is displayed.
The +version-label+ attribute controls the version number label in the byline.
The revision information attributes can also be explicitly set in the header.

include::rev-long.adoc[]
----
<1> When explicitly set, any characters preceding the version number are *not* dropped.
<2> The +revremark+ can contain attribute references.
<3> The +version-label+ attribute is unset so that the word _Version_ does not precede the +revnumber+ in the byline.

.Result: Rendered revision information when revision attributes are explicitly set
====

In the rendered document, notice that the _V_ preceding the +revnumber+ is capitalized in the byline but not when the attribute is referenced in the body of the document.

NOTE: Revision extraction information and an extraction example are pending.
