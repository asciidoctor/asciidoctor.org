////

Before you can use an attribute in your document, you must *set* it.
Sometimes, setting an attribute is also referred to as *toggling on*.
To set an attribute, you must add its name to the document.

Once set, many attributes can be assigned a value.
Values are the substitute text, content type, or operation that will replace any references to the attribute that the processor finds in the text.

An attribute reference is an inline element that calls the attribute entry with the same name.
An attribute's reference is its name enclosed in curly brackets.
The reference is replaced with the attribute's value when Asciidoctor processes the document.

A number of attributes and values are automatically used when the Asciidoctor processor renders a document.
These attributes are called intrinsic attributes.
For example, you do not need to set the `normal` attribute on a basic paragraph because it is set by an intrinsic attribute.
But when you want a paragraph to have a different style, such as `TIP`, you set the TIP attribute on a paragraph and TIP will override the intrinsic normal attribute.
Intrinsic attributes can be overridden or unset from the command line or within the document.

Attributes can be unset with the bang symbol (`!`).
The `!` can be placed before or after the attribute's name.

For example, both:

 :attribute_name!:

and

 :!attribute_name:

mean "do not number" and unset the `numbered` attribute.

The following sections will show you how to use attributes on your whole document, individual blocks, and inline elements.

NOTE: To learn about command line attributes and how to use them, proceed to <<processing-a-document>>.

Attributes can be set via the command line, in the document header, and on individual block and inline elements.

Attribute entries are most commonly set in the document header, though some can also be applied to individual elements.
Attribute lists are set on individual block and inline elements.

Attributes can also be assigned values.
Values can be

Most often, attributes are defined in the document header, but they can also be defined inline or on the command line.
