// Bruce Wolfe bwolfe@redhat.com 2013-04-26 Issue #284 - Asciidoctor update instructions

// A new introduction that introduces and ties together all the elements in the chain (installing gem, text editors, previewer) needs to be created eventually.

Asciidoctor, an implementation of the AsciiDoc processor written in Ruby, is a drop-in replacement for AsciiDoc in most cases.
Asciidoctor provides a command line tool and a Ruby API for converting AsciiDoc documents to HTML 5, Docbook 5.0, DocBook 4.5 and custom output formats.

//NOTE: To convert your document to PDF, you'll need to use the new {fopub-ref}[asciidoctor-fopub tool].
//Directions for using the tool are documented in the {fopub-doc-ref}[asciidoctor-fopub README].
