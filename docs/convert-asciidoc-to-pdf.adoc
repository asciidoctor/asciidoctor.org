Asciidoctor PDF is a native PDF renderer for AsciiDoc.
We're talking AsciiDoc direct to PDF!

.Project status
[NOTE]
====
{project-name} is currently _alpha_ software.
Use accordingly.
Though the bulk of AsciiDoc content is rendered, there's still work needed to fill in gaps where rendering is incomplete, incorrect or not implemented.
====

== Notable Features

* Direct AsciiDoc to PDF rendering
* Configuration-driven style and layout
* PDF document outline (i.e., bookmarks)
* Document metadata (title, authors, subject, keywords, etc)
* Internal cross reference links
* Syntax highlighting with CodeRay or Pygments
* Page breaks avoided in block content
* Orphan section titles avoided
* Table border settings honored

{project-name} is built with {uri-home}[Asciidoctor] and Prawn.
{uri-prawn}[Prawn] is a nimble PDF writer for Ruby.

=== Missing Features

See {uri-worklog}[WORKLOG].

== Prerequisites

Asciidoctor PDF requires Ruby 1.9.3 or greater and a few RubyGems, which we explain how to install in the next section.

To determine if you have Ruby available, open an terminal and use the `ruby` command to query the version installed.

 $ ruby --version

If you're using {uri-rvm}[RVM], we recommend creating a new gemset to work with Asciidoctor and {project-name}.

 $ rvm use @asciidoctor-pdf --create

RVM keeps the dependencies required by various projects isolated.

== Getting Started

{project-name} isn't yet published as a RubyGem, so you'll need to get the source code.

=== Retrieve the project

You can retrieve the {project-name} project in one of two ways:

. Clone the git repository
. Download a zip archive of the repository

==== Option 1: Fetch using git clone

If you want to clone the git repository, copy the {uri-repo}[GitHub repository URL] and pass it to `git clone` command.

 $ git clone https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf

Next, change to the project directory.

 $ cd asciidoctor-pdf

==== Option 2: Download the archive

If you want to download a zip archive, click on the btn:[Download Zip] button on the right-hand side of the repository page on GitHub.
Once the download finishes, extract the archive, open a console and change to that directory.

TIP: Instead of working out of the {project-handle} directory, you can simply add the directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

We'll leverage the project configuration to install the necessary dependencies.

=== Install the Dependencies

The dependencies needed to use {project-name} are defined in the [file]_Gemfile_ at the root of the project.
We can use Bundler to install the dependencies for us.

To see if you have Bundler available, use the `bundle` command to query the version installed.

 $ bundle --version

If it's not installed, use the `gem` command to install it.

 $ gem install bundle

Then use the `bundle` command to install the project dependencies.

 $ bundle install

You're now ready to use {project-name}.
Let's grab an AsciiDoc document to distill.

=== Example AsciiDoc document

If you don't already have an AsciiDoc document, you can use the [file]_example.adoc_ file found in the {uri-examples}[examples directory] of the {project-name} repository.

.example.adoc
[source]
----
= Document Title
Doc Writer <doc@example.com>
:doctype: book
:source-highlighter: coderay
:listing-caption: Listing

A simple http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] document.

== Introduction

A paragraph followed by a simple list with square bullets.

[square]
* item 1
* item 2

Here's how you say ``Hello, World!'' in Prawn:

.Create a basic PDF document using Prawn
[source,ruby]
....
require 'prawn'

Prawn::Document.generate 'example.pdf' do
  text 'Hello, World!'
end
....
----

It's time to convert the AsciiDoc document direct to PDF.

=== Convert AsciiDoc to PDF

The `generate-pdf` script converts an AsciiDoc document to a PDF.

From the root of your project, pass your AsciiDoc document to the script.

 $ ruby bin/asciidoctor-pdf example.adoc

When the script completes, you should see the file [file]_example.pdf_ in the same directory.
Open that file with a PDF viewer to see the result.

.Example PDF document rendered in a PDF viewer
image::example-pdf-screenshot.png[Screenshot of PDF document]

You're also encouraged to try rendering the documents in the examples directory to see more of what {project-name} can do.
Another example is the {uri-cdi}[CDI Specification].

The pain of the DocBook toolchain should be melting away about now.

== Themes

The layout and styling of the PDF is driven by a YAML configuration file.
See the files [file]_default-theme.yml_ and [file]_asciidoctor-theme.yml_ found in the {uri-themes}[data/themes directory] for examples.

== Additional Scripts

{project-name} also provides a shell script that invokes GhostScript (`gs`) to optimize and compress the generated PDF with minimal impact on quality.
You must have Ghostscript installed to use it.

Here's an example usage:

 $ ./bin/optimize-pdf example.pdf

The command will generate the file [file]_example-optimized.pdf_ in the current directory.
If a file is found with the extension `.pdfmarks` and the same rootname as the input file, it is used to add metadata to the generated PDF document.
This file is necessary to preserve the document metadata since Ghostscript will otherwise drop it.
That's why Asciidoctor PDF always creates this file in addition to the PDF.

== Contributing

In the spirit of free software, _everyone_ is encouraged to help improve this project.

To contribute code, simply fork the project on GitHub, hack away and send a pull request with your proposed changes.

Feel free to use the {uri-issues}[issue tracker] or {uri-mailinglist}[Asciidoctor mailing list] to provide feedback or suggestions in other ways.
