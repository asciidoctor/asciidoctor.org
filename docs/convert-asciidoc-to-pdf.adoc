Asciidoctor PDF is a native PDF renderer for AsciiDoc.
We're talking AsciiDoc _straight_ to PDF!

.Project status
CAUTION: {project-name} is currently _alpha_ software.
While the converter handles most AsciiDoc content, there's still work needed to fill in gaps where conversion is incomplete, incorrect or not implemented.
See the milestone v1.5.0 in the {uri-project-issues}[issue tracker] for details.

== Features

=== Notable features

* Direct AsciiDoc to PDF conversion
* Configuration-driven style and layout
* PDF document outline (i.e., bookmarks)
* Table of contents page(s)
* Document metadata (title, authors, subject, keywords, etc)
* Internal cross reference links
* Syntax highlighting with CodeRay or Pygments
* Page numbering
* Customizable running content (header and footer)
* “Keep together” blocks (i.e., page breaks avoided in certain block content)
* Orphan section titles avoided
* Table border settings honored
* Font-based icons (currently admonition blocks only)
* Custom fonts

{project-name} is built with {uri-home}[Asciidoctor] and Prawn.
{uri-prawn}[Prawn] is a nimble PDF writer for Ruby.

=== Missing features

See {uri-worklog}[WORKLOG].

== Prerequisites

All that's needed is Ruby (1.9.3 or better; 2.2.x recommended) and a few Ruby Gems, which we explain how to install in the next section.

To check you have Ruby available, use the `ruby` command to query the version installed:

 $ ruby --version

== Getting started

You can get {project-name} by installing the published gem.

=== Install the published gem

{project-name} is published in pre-release on RubyGems.org.
You can install the published gem using the following command:

 $ gem install --pre asciidoctor-pdf

If you want to syntax highlight source listings, you'll also want to install CodeRay or Pygments.
To be safe, go ahead and install both gems:

 $ gem install coderay pygments.rb

Assuming all the required gems install properly, verify you can run the `asciidoctor-pdf` script:

 $ asciidoctor-pdf -v

If you see the version of {project-name} printed, you're ready to use {project-name}.

Let's grab an AsciiDoc document to distill and start putting {project-name} to use!

=== An example AsciiDoc document

If you don't already have an AsciiDoc document, you can use the [file]_example.adoc_ file found in the {uri-examples}[examples directory] of the {project-name} repository.

.example.adoc
[source]
....
= Document Title
Doc Writer <doc@example.com>
:doctype: book
:source-highlighter: coderay
:listing-caption: Listing
// Uncomment next line to set page size (default is Letter)
//:pdf-page-size: A4

A simple http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] document.

== Introduction

A paragraph followed by a simple list with square bullets.

[square]
* item 1
* item 2

Here's how you say ``Hello, World!'' in Prawn:

.Create a basic PDF document using Prawn
[source,ruby]
----
require 'prawn'

Prawn::Document.generate 'example.pdf' do
  text 'Hello, World!'
end
----
....

It's time to convert the AsciiDoc document directly to PDF.

=== Convert AsciiDoc to PDF

IMPORTANT: You'll need to the `coderay` gem installed to run this example since it uses the `source-highlighter` attribute with the value of `coderay`.

Converting to PDF is a simple as running the `asciidoctor-pdf` script using Ruby and passing our AsciiDoc document as the first argument.

 $ asciidoctor-pdf example.adoc

This command is just a shorthand way of running:

 $ asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-pdf -b pdf example.adoc

When the script completes, you should see the file [file]_example.pdf_ in the same directory.
Open the [file]_example.pdf_ file with a PDF viewer to see the result.

You're also encouraged to try rendering the documents in the examples directory to see more of what {project-name} can do.

The pain of the DocBook toolchain should be melting away about now.

== Themes

The layout and styling of the PDF is driven by a YAML configuration file.
To learn how the theming system works and how to create and apply custom themes, refer to the {uri-theming-guide}[Asciidoctor PDF Theme Guide].
You can use the built-in theme files, which you can find in the [file]_data/themes_ directory, as examples.

== Optional scripts

{project-name} also provides a shell script that invokes GhostScript (`gs`) to optimize and compress the generated PDF with minimal impact on quality.
You must have Ghostscript installed to use it.

Here's an example usage:

 $ ./bin/optimize-pdf example.pdf

The command will generate the file [file]_example-optimized.pdf_ in the current directory.

WARNING: The `optimize-pdf` script currently requires a Bash shell (Linux, OSX, etc).
We plan to rewrite the script in Ruby so it works across platforms (see https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/issues/1[issue #1])

IMPORTANT: The `optimize-pdf` script relies on Ghostscript >= 9.10.
Otherwise, it may actually make the PDF larger.
Also, you should only consider using it if the file size of the original PDF is > 5MB.

If a file is found with the extension `.pdfmarks` and the same rootname as the input file, it is used to add metadata to the generated PDF document.
This file is necessary to preserve the document metadata since Ghostscript will otherwise drop it.
That's why {project-name} always creates this file in addition to the PDF.
