This page is a catalog of Asciidoctor extensions.
In this context, an extension is a library that enriches the AsciiDoc content either by introducing new syntax or weaving additional features into the output.
This differs from tool extensions, such as the Atom extension, which bring AsciiDoc support to the tool.

|====

NOTE: The label “official” simply means that the extension is hosted inside the Asciidoctor organization on GitHub and is maintained as part of the Asciidoctor project.
In contrast, a third-party extension is one hosted outside of the Asciidoctor organization.
This classification does not indicate the quality of the extension.
Instead, the quality should be based on the extension's own merit.
