“__Writing is hard__.”

That's what experience has conditioned us to believe.

But, we can't just avoid it, especially in the tech industry.
We _must_ write.
Even the most brilliant software is useless without good documentation.
If the users fail, so does the project.

[quote, Nick Coghlan]
Unless your UI discoverability is *really good*, saying “the feature isn't documented” is the same as saying “the product can't do it.”

In other words,

[quote, Matthew Ginnard]
Live and die by documentation.

Then why, _oh why_, do we make it more difficult by burying the content in XML schemas like DocBook, allowing complex word processors to distract us or wasting time battling with finicky WYSIWYG editors?

Imagine if writing documentation was as simple as writing an email.

_It *can* be_.

That's the idea behind lightweight markup languages such as AsciiDoc.
They offer a plain-text syntax, embellished with subtle, yet intuitive markup, that's designed for humans to read, write and edit in raw form.
The natural feel of the syntax keeps you focused on the content.
Best of all, the plain text can quickly and easily be translated into output formats such as HTML5 for presentation.

In this introduction to AsciiDoc, we'll cover what it is, why it's valuable and what sets it apart from alternatives such as Markdown.
You'll discover that the key to escaping the agony of writing documentation is dropping the angle brackets that are burying the knowledge you have to share.

To learn how to reduce the work of writing and publishing content--whether it's notes, documentation, articles, books, web pages or good ol`'-fashioned prose--and attain writing zen, or to simply set the ideas locked in your head free, read on.

== What is AsciiDoc?

AsciiDoc is two things:

. A mature{empty}footnote:[AsciiDoc is over two decades old. It was first introduced in 2002.], plain-text writing format for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, ebooks, web pages, slide decks, blog posts, man pages and more.
. A text processor and toolchain for translating AsciiDoc documents into various formats (called _backends_), including HTML, DocBook, PDF and ePub{empty}footnote:[There are two implementations of the AsciiDoc processor. The original processor, named AsciiDoc, is written in Python. A more modern implementation, named Asciidoctor, is written in Ruby.].

AsciiDoc belongs to the family of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language[lightweight markup languages], the most renowned of which is https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/[Markdown].
AsciiDoc stands out from this group because it supports all the structural elements necessary for drafting articles, technical manuals, books, presentations and prose.
In fact, it's capable of meeting even the most advanced publishing requirements and technical semantics.

Serving as testament of this fact, many O'Reilly authors including https://github.com/matthewmccullough[Matthew McCullough], https://github.com/tlberglund[Tim Berglund], https://github.com/oreillymedia/etudes-for-erlang[Simon St.Laurent], https://www.apeth.net/matt/iosbooktoolchain.html[Matt Neuburg] and https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/219[Ian Darwin] have used AsciiDoc to write their books for that iconic technical library.

From the very beginning, AsciiDoc was designed to be a shorthand replacement for https://docbook.org/whatis[DocBook], one of the formats AsciiDoc can generate.
AsciiDoc can also produce beautiful HTML5, PDFs, eBooks, man pages and even slide decks.
It has you covered from first draft to publishing.

Now that we've established what AsciiDoc is, let's consider why we need it.

== Why AsciiDoc?

As humans, we have no difficulty talking or thinking.
In fact, we're fluent in it.
It's an activity that just happens whenever a thought comes to mind.

_Writing, on the other hand, rarely comes so easy._

When it's time to write our thoughts down, we _struggle_ to find the words--or, at least, how to arrange and organize them.
That _damn_ inner critic disrupts the stream of consciousness we coast on while talking or thinking.

It's reasonable to conclude that writing is just hard.

_Or is it?_

=== On writing: e-mail vs documents

Writing e-mail is easy.
We do it all the time.
Every day, we respond to dozens of e-mail and social media messages.
That involves communication through writing.
That's right, _writing!_

Yet, amid the flurry of typing that occurs when we respond to an e-mail, we hardly even realize we're doing it...and _fluently!_

As it turns out...

[quote, 'https://blog.stoyanstefanov.com/asciidoc[Stoyan Stefanov]']
Most people are OK with writing e-mails.
They don't consider this writing.
There's no writer's block.
Someone asks you a question, you [press] reply and type away.

_So why do we struggle to write *documents*?_

The main reason we struggle is because we don't write documents the same way we write e-mail.
Instead, we allow ourselves to get distracted by complex word processors, bury the content in XML schemas like DocBook, or battle with finicky WYSIWYG editors.
How did we get ourselves into this mess?

=== Word processors, the real writer's block

When you're in the writing (i.e., https://blog.stoyanstefanov.com/writing-vs-typing/[typing]) phase, you want the words to flow onto the screen with minimal distractions and interruptions.
Flow, not just time, is essential.

Most word processors excel at distracting you from writing.
The result: _you write less_ (ironic, huh?).

In a word processor, before you can type the first word on a blank white screen, you're forced to think about what font family you want, what font size you want, what lines spacing you want and so on.
Once you do get going, auto-correct, spelling and grammar suggestions entice you to backtrack and lose your next thought.
“Smart” quotes and auto-linking messes with the text as fast as you can enter it.
If you paste text, it likely gets added to the document with a different font family, size and even color.

*Undo. Undo. Undo!*

Let's not even talk about inserting source code.
The designers of word processors clearly did not.

*Format. Format. Format!*

After burning time fighting with its interface, you rightfully conclude that the word processor is trying to _sabotage_ your writing process.

*We _need_ an easier way to write!*

But how?

=== Use what you know

_What if you could write documentation like you write e-mail?_

Imagine being able to forget about layout, typesetting, styling (and even some semantics) and just _write_.
That's the idea behind *lightweight markup languages* such as Markdown and AsciiDoc.

Here's how John Gruber introduced Markdown (in March 2004):

[quote, "John Gruber, Creator of Markdown"]
____
The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible.

A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

The single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown's syntax is the format of plain text e-mail.
____

Similarly, here's how Stuart Rackham introduced AsciiDoc (2 years earlier):

[quote, "Stuart Rackham, Creator of AsciiDoc"]
You write an AsciiDoc document the same way you would write a normal text document.
There are no markup tags or weird format notations.
AsciiDoc files are designed to be viewed, edited and printed directly or translated to other presentation formats.

These languages are designed to enable humans to write documents, and for other humans to be able to read them, *_as is_*, in _raw_ form.

Here's a basic example of an AsciiDoc document:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Introduction to AsciiDoc
Doc Writer <doc@example.com>

A preface about https://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc].

== First Section

* item 1
* item 2

[source,ruby]
puts "Hello, World!"
----

_It's a plain text syntax...I *know* this!_

Compare that to the same document written in DocBook:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

Yikes!

While DocBook (and HTML) may not be complex, they fail the readability test.

[quote, Dag Wieers]
DocBook is nice, but (like XML) it is not meant for editing nor for merging changes (by humans).
Using AsciiDoc (which translates to DocBook perfectly) is a much easier way of developing.

AsciiDoc gets us back to what's important: _writing_.
You can drop those angle brackets, but you don't have to drop the semantics.
And it's a syntax a human can actually edit, efficiently.

[quote, Linus Torvalds]
Use AsciiDoc for document markup.
Really.
It's actually *readable* by humans, easier to parse and way more flexible than XML.

Here's the really great thing about AsciiDoc.
Worse case scenario, you convert it to DocBook as a common exchange format.
DocBook is the “no lock-in” exit path for AsciiDoc.
You decide AsciiDoc doesn't work out, you can bail on it without losing a word.
No need to invent another format.
That's why so many people are going all in on it.

== Who's using AsciiDoc?

AsciiDoc is not as widely adopted as Markdown, but it's used in some pretty serious places. Here are a few notable examples:

- http://oreillynet.com/oreilly/authors/welcome/asciidoc.csp[O'Reilly] and https://github.com/MakerPress[MakerPress]
* http://clojure-cookbook.com[Clojure Cookbook] (https://github.com/clojure-cookbook/clojure-cookbook[AsciiDoc source])
- https://github.com[GitHub] supports AsciiDoc syntax in repositories, wikis and gists (powered by https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor])

These examples are more than just testimonials.
They should give you ideas about how to be successful with AsciiDoc for your own project.

== The zen of writing AsciiDoc

AsciiDoc is about being able to focus on expressing your ideas, writing with ease and passing on knowledge without the distraction of complex applications or angle brackets.
In other words, it's about discovering _writing zen_.

AsciiDoc works because:

- It's readable
- It's concise
- It's comprehensive
- It's extensible
- It produces beautiful output (HTML, DocBook, PDF, ePub and more)

AsciiDoc is easy to write and easy to read (in raw form).
It's also easy to proof and edit.
After all, it's plain text, just like that familiar e-mail.

The AsciiDoc syntax is intuitive because it recognizes time-tested, plain text conventions for marking up or structuring the text.
The punctuation was carefully chosen to look like what it means.
A user unfamiliar with AsciiDoc can figure out the structure and semantics (i.e., what you mean) just by looking at it.
Best of all, *it only requires a text editor to read or write*.

AsciiDoc allows you to focus on the actual writing and only worry about tweaking the output when you are ready to convert the document.
The plain-text of an AsciiDoc document is easily converted into a variety of output formats, beautifully formatted, without having to rewrite the content.

Copy text from an e-mail into a document and see how quickly you can turn it into documentation.
Almost immediately, you'll find your writing zen and enjoy the rewarding experience of sharing knowledge.

Live or die by documentation? +
“Live!”
