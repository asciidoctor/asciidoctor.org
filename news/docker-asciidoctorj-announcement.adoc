We're excited to announce the newest member of the {uri-asciidoctor}[Asciidoctor] family, {uri-repo}[Docker AsciidoctorJ].
The {uri-repo}[Docker AsciidoctorJ] project ensures that AsciidoctorJ can be used by any application deployed to a Java EE application server^*^.

^*^ For now, only {uri-wildfly}[WildFly] is tested. _Pull requests welcome!_

== What's it about?

This project provides:

A `Dockerfile`:: Builds a Docker image that includes WildFly 8.2, AsciidoctorJ 1.5.2 and AsciidoctorJ PDF 1.5.0
Arquillian tests:: Uses AsciidoctorJ inside a Docker container to convert AsciiDoc files to HTML and PDF files

The {uri-post}[following post] explains how we execute Arquillian tests for AsciidoctorJ in a WildFly Docker container.
We'll talk about:

* {uri-repo}[docker-asciidoctorj], the dedicated Asciidoctor GitHub project
* The {uri-asciidoctor-dockerhub}[official Asciidoctor organization] on Docker Hub
* {uri-arquillian-cube-github}[Arquillian Cube], the Arquillian extension that can be used to manage Docker containers from Arquillian
* The {uri-jboss-wildfly-docker}[WildFly Docker image] from JBoss
